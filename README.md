# Assignment
Rundoo Take-Home


Why we're asking you to do this ❓
We want you to think of this as less of a test and more of a project or puzzle. The goal of which is to help us both evaluate the following:

1. How much you enjoy this kind of work

2. How you assess tradeoffs in your decision-making

Our hope is that we both come out of this more excited to work together and you already have a head start thinking about things that'll come up on the job!



## What we're asking you to do 💻
Please build an API endpoint for creating a supplier, where a supplier consists of a name, logo, and address. Please also build a screen that exposes a form for entering that data; upon submission of that form, call the API endpoint you created.



## Frontend Framework 🖼️
Please use React and TypeScript. The rest is up to you!



## Data Persistence 💾
Data persistence is required! That said, please persist data however you'd like.



## Time ⏳
Feel free to take as much time as you need. We fully expect that you'll take shortcuts and do things out of the ordinary; we can talk about how you'd do things differently when you come in for your onsite!



## Authentication 🔒
Ignore authentication. Assume all pages and endpoints are publicly accessible.



## Other Notes 📝
Feel free to look up anything along the way and use libraries as you see fit. In general, treat this just as you would if we were actually working together and today was another day at work!
